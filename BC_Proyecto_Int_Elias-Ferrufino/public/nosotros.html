            By now you should already know what sourdough is, but, in any case, we give you a little reminder as we explained in our article "The secrets of sourdough": Sourdough is a symbiotic culture of yeasts present in foods naturally, such as cereals. This sourdough, which can be solid or liquid, is therefore a dough that has been fermented for many hours and very slowly, together with flour, salt, water and yeast (optional).
        </p>

        <p>
            After knowing its meaning, could you tell us what its origin is? We explain it to you in today's article!
        </p>
        
        <p>
            It is said that the Egyptians, 2,000 years before Christ, mistakenly discovered sourdough, creating a fermentation of flour and water. Years later, once the technique was improved and a little salt added, it was used to make bread.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Egyptians are the promoters of bread thanks to its excellent location, since they were inhabitants of very fertile lands. Even, in the Louvre museum in Paris, you can see Egyptian statues of millers and bakers, as well as the fresco of Ramses II where you can see the technique used by the Egyptians to knead sourdough: crushing it with their feet. A most curious fact!
        </p>

        <p>        
            But it was not until years later when another culture took over from the Egyptians and continued with the trade of bread; developing and improving sourdough. We are talking about the Greeks. They were a civilization that gradually assimilated the trade and gradually perfected it. The Egyptians discovered the origin of bread, but it was Greece that acquired great importance in gastronomy and positioned itself as the main axis of food in the West.            
        </p>

        <p>
            Yes, the origin of sourdough goes back many, many years, and we are still perfecting it today. At Turris, we work with a sourdough that makes the bread much more digestible, since fermentation produces a pre-digestion of the starch present in the cereals.
        </p>

        <p>
            Did you know that at Turris we teach how to make sourdough? Yes, we do solidarity workshops where we teach how to make various desserts, bread and, among them, sourdough. You learn with Xavier Barriga while helping someone in need.
